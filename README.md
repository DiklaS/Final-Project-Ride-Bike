# Final-Project-Ride-Bike

### Introduction
This project focuses on creating a platform for buying and selling second-hand mountain bicycle equipment. It consists of two main components: the Frontend ("Final Project- React") and the Backend ("Final Project- Server").

The Frontend handles the user interface, allowing users to browse and list equipment. It's built using React.

The Backend manages server-side operations, including equipment listings and user interactions. It's implemented in Node.js.

In this README, we'll provide details on setting up and running both components.

### Frontend (Final Project- React)
#### Description
The Frontend component, "Final Project- React", serves as the user interface for our marketplace. It enables users to browse, search for, and list second-hand mountain bicycle equipment. This component is built using React and various related technologies.

#### Key Features
* User-friendly interface for equipment listings and searches.
* Integration with backend APIs to fetch and display equipment data.
* Utilizes React components, styles, and routing for a seamless user experience.
  
#### Getting Started
To set up and run the Frontend, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the "Final Project- React" folder in your terminal.
2. Run npm install to install the required dependencies.
3. Before proceeding, ensure that you have started the Backend server. 
4. Execute npm start to launch the development server for the Frontend, and access the app in your browser at http://localhost:3000.
Please refer to the Backend's README or documentation for instructions on how to start the server.

### Backend (Final Project- Server)
#### Description
The Backend component, "Final Project- Server", powers the server-side operations and database management for our marketplace. It's implemented in Node.js and provides essential functionalities for managing equipment listings, user accounts, and interactions.

#### Key Features
* RESTful APIs for listing, searching, and managing mountain bicycle equipment.
* User authentication and authorization for secure transactions.
* Integration with a database (not specified in provided information) to store equipment and user data.

#### Getting Started
To set up and run the Backend, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the "Final Project- Server" folder in your terminal.
2. Run npm install to install the required server-side dependencies.
3. To run the Node.js server, use one of the following commands:
   * Production environment: npm start
   * Development environment (with automatic code reloading): npm run dev
     
The server will start running and listen for incoming requests on the specified port. Access the server by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost:PORT, where PORT is the configured port number. 

### Additional Notes
* Ensure that you have Node.js and npm installed on your system to run both the Frontend and Backend.
* You may need to configure API endpoints, specify the database used, and implement user authentication to make the Frontend and Backend work seamlessly together.
* Feel free to refer to the respective README files within each component's folder for more detailed instructions and project-specific information.

Enjoy developing your mountain bicycle equipment marketplace!
