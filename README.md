# Final-Project-Ride-Bike

### Introduction
This project focuses on creating a platform for buying and selling second-hand mountain bicycle equipment. It consists of two main components: the Frontend ("Final Project- React") and the Backend ("Final Project- Server").

The Frontend handles the user interface, allowing users to browse and list equipment. It's built using React.

The Backend manages server-side operations, including equipment listings and user interactions. It's implemented in Node.js.

In this README, we'll provide details on setting up and running both components.
